/*There are many ways to make aynchronous calls in Javascript: Promises, callbacks, Asyc/Await - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-promise-and-async-await-in-node-js/
  Best Practice: A current practice is to use Async Await.  
  Async / Await - https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-async-and-await and https://javascript.info/async-await
  When creating functions in Javascript there are two notations for functions: regular notation and arrow notation. 
    Syntax & Examples - Async / Await - regular function notation function functionName() -  https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_async.asp
    Syntax & Examples - Async / Await - arrow notation ()=> https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/async-await-function-in-javascript/
  Best Practice: When making asynchronous calls, you need to handle errors.
    Try-Catch - Wrap your code in Try and Catch errors - try {code} catch (error){handle error} - https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_errors.asp#:~:text=The%20try%20statement%20defines%20a,statement%20defines%20a%20custom%20error.
    Throw Errors -  if (err) throw err;  - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/throw
    */

//For this starter code I will use async-await and regular async functional notation. Feel free to ues the syntax that works best for you.

  /*In this file - queries.js - You will define several queries that retreive, remove, add, and update listing entries in the database. 
    One of the reasons we are using sequelize is that it make it easy to query the database without writing explicit SQL queries in our code. 
    Learn more about the finder methods available to sequelize models - https://sequelize.org/docs/v6/core-concepts/model-querying-finders/

    While sequelize will allow us to write raw queries, this is not recommended and precautions need to be made connecting with your database.  
      - Writing raw sql queries - https://sequelize.org/docs/v6/core-concepts/raw-queries/ - 
      - Identifying and Mitigating SQL-Injection Vulnerabilities - https://appsbd.com/sql-injection-attack-fixing-orm-is-not-enough/
    
    Security Best Practice: It is not recommended for developers to writing explicit SQL queries in code. This leaves us vulnerable for SQL injection and other software vulnerabilities. 
    Seurity Best Practices: Use a tool to monitor vulnerabilities and to scan your code for vulnerabilities.
    - Example - SQL Injection affecting Sequelize - https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-SEQUELIZE-2932027
    - Checkout the CVE and GitHub refs to see examples - https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-25813
    - Click on some of the Github examples and look at the workarounds and check that you are running the latest version of the Sequelize where patches have been issued.
